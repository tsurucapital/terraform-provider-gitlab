## Importing pre-registered runners

You can import a runner state using `terraform import <resource> <id>`.  The
`id` can be whatever the [get runner's details API][https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#get-runners-details] takes for
its `:id` value, so for example:

    terraform import gitlab_project.example 123
